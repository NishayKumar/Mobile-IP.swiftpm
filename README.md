# **Mobile IP ** 

I am proud to have developed an application that effectively showcases the complex process of data packets traveling through a network, starting from the correspondent node and ending at the mobile node. The application utilizes animations to visually illustrate this process and demonstrates my expertise in mobile app development and design.

Furthermore, the application also includes the mobile node's response to the data packets received, highlighting the bi-directional nature of the communication process. The majority of the application was built using the SwiftUI framework, a powerful tool for developing dynamic and interactive user interfaces, while the icons and overall design were created using Figma and Canva.
